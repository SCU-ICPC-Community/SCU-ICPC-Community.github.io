# About Us

Hello this is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:

Problem-solving is an essential skill for every programmer. So, we at {{ site.author.name }} believe that competitive programming helps students to improve their problem-solving skills. Our dream is to participate in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Dreams never come true by desire you have to pursue them so we hold real contests to familiarize the students with the passion of the contest. We give weekly sessions to keep track of the progress made by students, explain new topics, solve tricky problems, help students get their hands dirty implementing algorithms and data structures, and get prepared to participate in Egyptian Collegiate Programming Contest (ECPC).
